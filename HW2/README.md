# Homework 2 : RISC-V Program (A simple calculator)
### Task

* To use a RISC-V simulator to develop a simple calculator program which supports `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operation.
* Input : Read from `input.txt`. Input file will contain 3 lines, where −1024 ≤ `A`,`B` ≤ 1024; `A`, `B`, `<operator>` ∈ Z
    * Line1: `A`
    * Line2: `<operator>`
    * Line3: `B` 

     
* Output : Write to `output.txt`.
    * If the operator is `+`, `-`, `*` or `/` then output the result integer
    * If the operator is unsupported operator, then print `op not supported`
    * If divided by 0 occurs, then print `divided by zero`
